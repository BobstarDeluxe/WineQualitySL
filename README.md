# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Project
CSCA 5622 Supervised Learning Final Project

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. 

By analyzing various chemical components such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content, models were implemented to predict wine quality scores, providing valuable insights for wine producers and quality control processes. These models were compared for their statistical accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains measurements of 11 chemical properties for 1,143 wine samples, along with their quality ratings (scale 3-8).

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- **Data Analysis**: Extensive exploratory data analysis of wine chemical properties
- **Feature Engineering**: Created specialized features to better capture chemical relationships
- **Multiple Models**: Implemented and compared Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and SVR
- **Key Findings**: Identified alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates as top quality predictors

## 📈 Results
Our best model (KNN) achieved an R² score of 0.47, explaining nearly half of the variance in wine quality with chemical measurements alone.
